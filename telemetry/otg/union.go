Package otg is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was true
in this case).

This package was generated by /usr/local/google/home/gdennis/go/pkg/mod/github.com/openconfig/ygot@v0.23.1/genutil/names.go
using the following YANG input files:
  - models-yang/models/isis/open-traffic-generator-isis.yang
  - models-yang/models/types/open-traffic-generator-types.yang
  - models-yang/models/flow/open-traffic-generator-flow.yang
  - models-yang/models/discovery/open-traffic-generator-discovery.yang
  - models-yang/models/interface/open-traffic-generator-port.yang
  - models-yang/models/bgp/open-traffic-generator-bgp.yang
