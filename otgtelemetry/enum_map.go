/*
Package otgtelemetry is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was true
in this case).

This package was generated by /home/athena/go/pkg/mod/github.com/openconfig/ygot@v0.16.3/genutil/names.go
using the following YANG input files:
	- gnmi-collector-metadata.yang
	- models-yang/models/isis/open-traffic-generator-isis.yang
	- models-yang/models/types/open-traffic-generator-types.yang
	- models-yang/models/flow/open-traffic-generator-flow.yang

	- models-yang/models/interface/open-traffic-generator-port.yang
